# Url-Shotner

This is my first ever project in pyhton. 

It contains three versy small modules
1.) main.py
2.) urlDB.py - code related to database maintained for the original url and shorten url.
3.) algo.py - which contains the algorith to shorten the url, basicall it converts the "id" returned by urlDB.py module to base62 

In the algorithm we could have used base10 but preferred to use base62 because of the large number of possibilities for the shortened urls.

This might not be a very advanced version but I'll keep improving it and will keep learning.
